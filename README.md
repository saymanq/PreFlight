# Preflight

**Plan before you build.** Preflight is an AI-powered architecture planner that turns your app idea into a validated, implementation-ready tech stack — in under 10 minutes.

## What it does

Describe your idea in plain English. Preflight generates a visual architecture, scores it across 8 dimensions, lints it for anti-patterns, and exports prompt packs you can hand off to Cursor, Claude Code, or Lovable.

## Features

- **AI Architecture Generation** — Go from idea to a full system design with one prompt
- **Visual Canvas** — Drag-and-drop editor with 200+ components (databases, APIs, auth, infra, AI/ML)
- **Smart Scoring** — 8-dimension analysis: build speed, scalability, cost, reliability, and more
- **Architecture Linter** — Catches design mistakes and suggests fixes before you write a line of code
- **Version Comparison** — Generate alternative architectures and compare trade-offs side by side
- **Export Handoff** — JSON, Markdown, Mermaid diagrams, and AI-ready prompt packs

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Flow, Framer Motion
- **Backend:** Convex (database + real-time sync)
- **Auth:** Clerk
- **AI:** Azure OpenAI
